**Risk**: Privacy-preserving algorithms may impact performance
**Mitigation**: Optimize algorithms and use efficient implementations
**Contingency**: Implement fallback to simpler privacy mechanisms

### RK-203: Credential Format Support
**Risk**: Supporting multiple credential formats may be complex
**Mitigation**: Focus on W3C VCs, add other formats later

### RK-204: ZKP Integration Complexity
**Risk**: Zero-knowledge proof integration may be complex
**Mitigation**: Start with simple ZKP circuits, add complexity gradually
**Contingency**: Use simpler privacy mechanisms initially
