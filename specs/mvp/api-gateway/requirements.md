# API Gateway Requirements - MVP

## Overview

The API Gateway serves as the entry point for all external traffic to the Pavilion Trust Broker MVP. It handles TLS termination, JWT validation, rate limiting, and routing to internal services.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-101: TLS Termination
**Priority**: High  
**Epic**: E-101: Security & Authentication

The gateway must terminate TLS connections and handle SSL/TLS certificates.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Terminate TLS 1.3 connections
- [ ] Support self-signed certificates for development
- [ ] Validate certificate chains
- [ ] Handle certificate renewal
- [ ] Support SNI (Server Name Indication)

**User Story**: US-101: As a security engineer, I want TLS termination so that all traffic is encrypted.

### FR-102: JWT Validation
**Priority**: High  
**Epic**: E-101: Security & Authentication

The gateway must validate JWT tokens before forwarding requests to internal services.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Validate JWT signature using Keycloak public keys
- [ ] Check JWT expiration and not-before claims
- [ ] Extract user claims and roles from JWT
- [ ] Reject invalid or expired tokens
- [ ] Log authentication failures

**User Story**: US-102: As a compliance officer, I want JWT validation so that only authenticated requests are processed.

### FR-103: Rate Limiting
**Priority**: Medium  
**Epic**: E-102: Performance & Protection

The gateway must implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Limit requests per RP per minute
- [ ] Implement sliding window rate limiting
- [ ] Return appropriate HTTP 429 responses
- [ ] Include rate limit headers in responses
- [ ] Configure different limits for different RP tiers

**User Story**: US-103: As a DevOps engineer, I want rate limiting so that the system is protected from abuse.

### FR-104: Request Routing
**Priority**: High  
**Epic**: E-103: Core Functionality

The gateway must route requests to appropriate internal services.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Route `/api/v1/verify` to Core Broker
- [ ] Route `/health` to Core Broker
- [ ] Route `/admin/*` to Admin UI
- [ ] Handle 404 for unknown routes
- [ ] Support path-based routing

**User Story**: US-104: As an RP developer, I want reliable routing so that my requests reach the correct service.

### FR-105: Request/Response Logging
**Priority**: Medium  
**Epic**: E-104: Observability

The gateway must log all incoming requests and outgoing responses for audit purposes.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Log request method, path, and headers
- [ ] Log response status and timing
- [ ] Include request ID for correlation
- [ ] Mask sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Support structured JSON logging

**User Story**: US-105: As a compliance officer, I want request logging so that I can audit API usage.

### FR-106: CORS Support
**Priority**: Medium  
**Epic**: E-103: Core Functionality

The gateway must support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for web clients.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Handle preflight OPTIONS requests
- [ ] Set appropriate CORS headers
- [ ] Support configurable allowed origins
- [ ] Handle credentials in CORS requests
- [ ] Validate CORS policies

**User Story**: US-106: As a frontend developer, I want CORS support so that web applications can use the API.

### FR-107: Health Check Endpoint
**Priority**: Low  
**Epic**: E-104: Observability

The gateway must provide a health check endpoint for monitoring.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Expose `/health` endpoint
- [ ] Check internal service health
- [ ] Return appropriate status codes
- [ ] Include response time metrics
- [ ] Support graceful degradation

**User Story**: US-107: As a DevOps engineer, I want health monitoring so that I can ensure gateway availability.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-101: Performance
**Priority**: High

- **Response Time**: < 50ms for gateway processing
- **Throughput**: 1,000 requests/second
- **Resource Usage**: < 1GB RAM, < 0.5 CPU core
- **Concurrent Connections**: 10,000 simultaneous connections

### NFR-102: Security
**Priority**: High

- **TLS 1.3**: All external connections encrypted
- **JWT Validation**: All requests authenticated
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse
- **Request Validation**: Input sanitization and validation

### NFR-103: Reliability
**Priority**: High

- **Availability**: 99.5% uptime
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation on failures
- **Circuit Breaker**: Protect downstream services
- **Retry Logic**: Handle transient failures

### NFR-104: Scalability
**Priority**: Medium

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple gateway instances
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across instances
- **Configuration**: External configuration management
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimize for container deployment

## Technical Constraints

### MVP Constraints
- **Deployment**: Local Docker Compose environment
- **TLS**: Self-signed certificates for development
- **Authentication**: Keycloak single-realm integration
- **Rate Limiting**: In-memory rate limiting
- **Logging**: Local file logging

### Dependencies
- **Core Broker**: For verification requests
- **Admin UI**: For administrative interface
- **Keycloak**: For JWT validation
- **Redis**: For rate limiting (optional)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **RK-101**: JWT validation performance under load
- **RK-102**: TLS certificate management
- **RK-103**: Rate limiting accuracy

### Medium Risk
- **RK-104**: Request routing reliability
- **RK-105**: CORS policy configuration
- **RK-106**: Health check accuracy

### Low Risk
- **RK-107**: Logging performance impact
- **RK-108**: Configuration management

## Success Criteria

### MVP Success Metrics
- [ ] Gateway processes requests in < 50ms
- [ ] JWT validation works correctly for all valid tokens
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse effectively
- [ ] All requests routed to correct services
- [ ] TLS termination works with self-signed certificates
- [ ] CORS requests handled correctly
- [ ] Health checks pass consistently
- [ ] Request logging captures all traffic
