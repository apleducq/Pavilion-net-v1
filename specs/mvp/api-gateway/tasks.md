## Risk Assessment

### RK-101: Keycloak Integration Complexity
**Risk**: Keycloak setup and JWT validation may be more complex than expected
**Mitigation**: Start with simple JWT validation, add Keycloak integration incrementally
**Contingency**: Use mock JWT validation for initial development

### RK-102: Rate Limiting Performance
**Risk**: Redis-based rate limiting may impact performance
**Mitigation**: Use efficient Redis operations and connection pooling
**Contingency**: Implement in-memory rate limiting as fallback

### RK-103: TLS Certificate Management
**Risk**: Certificate rotation and validation may be complex
**Mitigation**: Use automated certificate management tools
**Contingency**: Manual certificate rotation process

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **Keycloak**: For JWT validation and user management
- **Redis**: For rate limiting and caching
- **Core Broker**: For request routing
- **TLS Certificates**: For HTTPS termination

### Internal Dependencies
- **E-101** → **E-102**: Authentication must be working before routing
- **E-102** → **E-103**: Routing must be working before monitoring
- **E-103** → **E-104**: Monitoring must be working before optimization

## Success Criteria

### Functional
- [ ] All API requests are routed correctly
- [ ] JWT authentication works with Keycloak
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] CORS support enables browser access
- [ ] Health checks return accurate status

### Non-Functional
- [ ] Response time < 50ms for authenticated requests
- [ ] Throughput > 1000 requests/second
- [ ] 99.9% uptime during testing
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Comprehensive logging and monitoring
