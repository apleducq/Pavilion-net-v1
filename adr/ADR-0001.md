## Context

Pavilion Trust Broker needs to handle privacy-preserving verification requests between Relying Parties (RPs) and Data Providers (DPs). The system must be scalable, maintainable, and support different deployment models (MVP local development vs production multi-region).

We need to choose between:
1. **Monolithic Architecture**: Single application handling all concerns
2. **Microservices Architecture**: Separate services for different concerns
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Services communicating via events

## Decision

We will adopt a **microservices architecture** with clear service boundaries and HTTP-based communication.

### Service Decomposition
- **API Gateway**: TLS termination, JWT validation, rate limiting, routing
- **Core Broker**: Request orchestration, policy enforcement, privacy engine
- **Policy Service**: OPA-based authorization decisions
- **DP Connector**: Data provider communication and data retrieval
- **Audit Service**: Immutable audit logging with Merkle proofs
- **Admin UI**: Web interface for monitoring and administration

### Communication Pattern
- **Synchronous HTTP**: For request-response flows
- **Pull-based**: DP Connector pulls jobs from Core Broker
- **Event-driven**: For audit logging and monitoring

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Scalability**: Services can scale independently based on load
- **Technology Flexibility**: Different services can use optimal technologies
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work on services independently
- **Fault Isolation**: Service failures don't cascade to entire system
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Services can be deployed independently

### Negative
- **Complexity**: More moving parts to manage and monitor
- **Network Overhead**: HTTP communication between services
- **Data Consistency**: Distributed data management challenges
- **Operational Overhead**: More services to deploy and maintain
- **Debugging Complexity**: Distributed tracing needed for troubleshooting

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for production to handle service-to-service communication
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures
- **API Gateway**: Centralized routing and security
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes for production deployment

## Alternatives Considered

### Monolithic Architecture
- **Pros**: Simpler deployment, easier debugging, single codebase
- **Cons**: Harder to scale individual components, technology lock-in, team coordination challenges
- **Rejection**: Would limit scalability and team autonomy

### Event-Driven Architecture
- **Pros**: Loose coupling, high scalability, natural audit trail
- **Cons**: Complex debugging, eventual consistency challenges, message ordering issues
- **Rejection**: Too complex for MVP, HTTP-based communication is sufficient for current needs

### Serverless Architecture
- **Pros**: Auto-scaling, pay-per-use, managed infrastructure
- **Cons**: Cold start latency, vendor lock-in, limited control
- **Rejection**: Privacy requirements need more control over data handling
