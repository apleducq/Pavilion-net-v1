- Verify performance meets MVP requirements
- Confirm security and compliance features work
- Demonstrate audit trail integrity

### Test Scope

#### In Scope (MVP)

- Privacy-preserving record linkage (Bloom-filter PPRL)
- JWT authentication and policy enforcement
- Audit logging with Merkle proofs
- Basic performance testing
- Security testing of critical paths

#### Out of Scope (MVP)
- Load testing beyond MVP requirements
